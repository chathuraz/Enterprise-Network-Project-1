Departmental Network in Cisco Packet Tracer

**Description:**

This repository contains a Cisco Packet Tracer project featuring a basic departmental network setup. The network consists of two sections: Accounts and Delivery, with all PCs, switches, and routers properly configured using appropriate IP addresses, subnet masks, and gateways. All devices are connected using suitable cables, ensuring seamless communication between departments.

**Key Features:**

âœ… Accounts and Delivery department network design

âœ… Proper IP addressing, subnetting, and gateway configurations

âœ… Fully connected devices with appropriate cabling

âœ… Tested and verified inter-departmental communication

This project serves as a foundational networking exercise, demonstrating structured network design and implementation using Cisco Packet Tracer.
